# Puppeteer

The example used to describe the Puppeteer technology contains one test Puppeteer screenshot sample (for new commit).



The following script was used to create this task:

```java
{  module.exports = async function browser, {inputParameters, previousResult}) {
   const page = await browser.newPage();
   await page.goto(inputParameters.testTargetUrl);
   // console.log(await page.content());
   await page.screenshot({path: process.env.SCREENSHOTS_PATH + '/' + 'screenshot.png'});
   await page.screenshot({path: process.env.SHARED_ORDER_PATH + '/' + 'screenshot.png'});
   return {created: true, taskTitle: inputParameters.taskTitle};
}
```
<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Important**: start every script as in the example: `module.exports = async function`

## Script path

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Remember** to ensure that your repository is added to the list at the Repository Addresses on the PowerFarm platform.



Choose your repository while creating a new Task, and paste the respective script path from it. 



You can copy the file path in the GitHub repository by clicking the â€˜Copy pathâ€™ button.


If your script is in the GitLab repository, you can copy the file path by using the icon  .



Once the Task has been created, you can copy the repository path from the Taskâ€™s details.



## Script details

### Parameters
There are three possible parameters you can add to your script:
1. `secretParameter` - encrypted arguments
2. `inputParameter` 
3. `previousResults` - passing arguments from the previous test

On the PowerFarm platform, there are two types of parameters, called arguments:
1. local arguments - can be added to and used in one script only;
2. global arguments - can be used in many scripts.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> ðŸ’¡ **Remember**, there is no differentiation between local and global arguments (parameters) in scripts. 

In this script, there are two parameters used:

1. input Parameters
```java
await page.goto(inputParameters.testTargetUrl);
```
the local argument (used only for this specific task).



2. previous Result 
```java
module.exports = async function browser, {inputParameters, previousResult}) {
```
passing the argument from the previously executed task; it is not seen in the details of this task, but the output of the previous task.

> ðŸ’¡ **Notice**, the parameter can be used in the script, but no results will be displayed if there was no specify what kind of argument should be executed in the tests.

## Environment variables
In the example, as the environment variables are screenshots. 
```java
await page.screenshot({path: process.env.SCREENSHOTS_PATH + '/' + 'screenshot.png'});
   await page.screenshot({path: process.env.SHARED_ORDER_PATH + '/' + 'screenshot.png'});
```

The screenshots are displayed and can be downloaded in the Job results window.

## Output
The output is displayed in JSON format. Write the script according to the example:
```java
return {created: true, taskTitle: inputParameters.taskTitle};
```

The output of the executed tasks in the workflow (job) is displayed on the PowerFarm platform in the jobâ€™s details (jobâ€™s results).
