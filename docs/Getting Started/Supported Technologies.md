# Supported-Technologies

Scripts are the heart of automated tests executed on the PowerFarm platform. There are many possible solutions to be used - by languages, test frameworks, or optional libraries (e.g., Selenium WebDriver or Puppeteer). Business technologies can be divided into automates for the web, rest services, for desktop and mobile.


Our platform supports scripts created in the following technologies:
