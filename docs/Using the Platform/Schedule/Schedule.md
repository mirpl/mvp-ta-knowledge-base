# Schedule

Last but not least stage of your trip through PowerFarm platform is to learn more about Schedule and Triggers ðŸ‘‡


The schedule list contains all Jobs for which the user created Trigger: set the precise execution time and, in some cases, also determined the Job repetitions in defined periods and its finish date. 

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡  **Remember**, the Triggers were created while setting up New Jobs; if you want to change them, get back to the Jobs details.

Go to the Schedule list, and check out the details it displays.
ID - the number, which, at the same time, is the link directing to the Schedule details
Workflow name - the name the creator gave for this Workflow 
Trigger details - Workflowâ€™s execution date and hour
Next run - displayed when the Workflow hasnâ€™t been finished yet
Finish date - displayed when the Workflow has been completed
Buttons:
- Pause Trigger - available for ongoing Workflows; click it if you want to pause the Trigger for some time
- Resume - available for the paused Workflows; click it if you want to resume given Workflow
- Delete - available for the paused Workflows; click it if you want to delete given Workflow
- Trigger Finished - that indicates the Workflow has been completed

The Schedule list contains a pretty lot of data, doesnâ€™t it? But in case you want to see more, click at any Workflow ID and check out the Jobs statuses.
