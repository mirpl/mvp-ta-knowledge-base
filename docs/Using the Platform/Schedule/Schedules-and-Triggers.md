# Schedules and Triggers

The schedule list contains all Jobs for which the user created Trigger: set the precise execution time and, in some cases, also determined the Job repetitions in defined periods and its finish date. 

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡  **Remember**, the Triggers were created while setting up New Jobs; if you want to change them, get back to the [Jobs details](url).

Go to the Schedule list, and check out the details it displays.

**ID** - the number, which, at the same time, is the link directing to the Schedule details

**Test Plan name** - the name the creator gave for this Test Plan 

**Trigger details** - Test Plan's execution date and hour

**Next run** - displayed when the Test Plan hasnâ€™t been finished yet
Finish date - displayed when the Test Plan has been completed
Buttons:
- Pause Trigger - available for ongoing Test Plans; click it if you want to pause the Trigger for some time
- Resume - available for the paused Test Plans; click it if you want to resume given Test Plan
- Delete - available for the paused Test Plans; click it if you want to delete given Test Plan
- Trigger Finished - that indicates the Test Plan has been completed

The Schedule list contains a pretty lot of data, doesnâ€™t it? But in case you want to see more, click at any Test Plan ID and check out the Jobs statuses.
