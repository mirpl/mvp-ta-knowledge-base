Everything good and exciting about PowerFarm starts with creating the new Test  ðŸ’¬. 

<!-- theme: info -->

>**Test** - Single test script that can work on its own and perform one task. It can be combined with other scripts to create the whole scenario of the test case.


## Creating the Test

First, select the 'Tests' button on the left side of the screen and click the â€˜Create New Test' button on the top right corner. 
It doesnâ€™t sound complicated, right? ðŸ˜Ž

**3**. Select technology: just drop-down the list of technologies in which you wrote your test script and click the one you need. 

**4**. Now, select one of the script directories - also accessible on the drop-down list - and **5** enter the path to the script you want to use in this Test.
