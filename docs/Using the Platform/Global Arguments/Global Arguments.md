# Global Arguments

There are two types of Arguments used in PowerFarm: 
1. Global Arguments  
2. Local Arguments. 

In settings, the User creates the Arguments Collection, also called Global Arguments since they might be selected and added to every new Job in the Platform - the list of Arguments Collection is available on the form for creating Jobs. 

First, name your Collection: click the ‘Create Arguments Collection’ button, type the name, and save it. The application will open the page where you can add as many arguments as you wish by clicking on the ‘Add Argument’ button.
