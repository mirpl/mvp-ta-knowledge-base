There are two types of Arguments used in PowerFarm: 
1. Global Arguments - can be added to every Job 
2. Local Arguments - are added to certain Job

From the level of main menu, the User can create the Global Arguments since **they might be selected and added to every new Job in the Platform** - the list of them will be available on the form for creating Jobs. 

The space with all Global arguments contains:
1. the 'Create Global arguments' button
2. sorting by the order of creating
3. the 'Delete' button
