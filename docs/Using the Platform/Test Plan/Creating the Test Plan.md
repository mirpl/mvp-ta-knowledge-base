# Creating the Test Plan

Click the â€˜Create new workflowâ€™ button on the top right corner of the screen to display the form to fill. 

For now, you only provide the Workflowâ€™s name, an optional description, and choose a ParallelðŸ’¬  or SequentialðŸ’¬  checkbox. Once you click the â€˜Saveâ€™ button, your new Workflow will appear on the list. 

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡ We **recommend** creating both Parallel and Sequential Workflows to practice the following steps.

### Parallel Workflow


>ðŸ’¬ Definition alert! ðŸ””
**Parallel** - scripts are executed at the same time without any dependencies.


Select your new Parallel workflow from the list to display the details on the screen and add a Flow to it. 
Itâ€™s easy - just click the â€˜Add processes to the workflowâ€™ button on the bottom of the page and choose as many Processes as you wish by clicking at the â€˜Addâ€™ button next to them on the displayed form. 

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Remember**, the form will show all created Processes in the application, so make sure you have a proper amount on the Processes list to practice this step.

Once youâ€™ve finished adding Processes to your new Workflow, confirm this action by clicking the â€˜Save Process for Workflowâ€™. If you want to dismiss it, click the â€˜Closeâ€™ button and none of the chosen Processes will be added. 


### Sequential Workflow
>ðŸ’¬ Definition alert! ðŸ””
**Sequential** - scripts are executed one after another. If one script fails then the next ones are not executed.

>Excellent! Give yourself pat on the back and keep on. ðŸ‘Š
