You now know how to create Tests and Test Plans, but to start the actual experience of Test Automation, you need to create the Job ðŸ’¬.

>ðŸ’¬ Definition alert! ðŸ””
**Job** - Execution of a Test Plan.

## Create a New Job

There are two ways of creating a new Job. 
1.  find the â€˜Create Jobâ€™ button on the Test Plan list, next to every Test Plan.

2. open Test Plan's details and find the â€˜Create Jobâ€™ button in the top right corner of the page.

Clicking the â€˜Create Jobâ€™ button will open the form to fill in.

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Remember**, if the button is unclickable, the Tests were not added to the Test Plan yet.

<!-- theme: info -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Notice**, you can return to the added Test details page by clicking the â€˜Go to Test' button. 

Filling in the â€˜Create New Jobâ€™ form consists of four steps. A separate form and graphic pointer outline each of them:

### Choose Versions of the Test

The form of choosing the Test Version displays every Test added to the Test Plan. For each of them, select branch **1** along with commit you want to use for this Job.

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Remember**, if there were no commits in the Test, you cannot select Branch and Commit.

Next, select the Tag **2** and Commit hash ðŸ’¬ **3**. 

<!-- theme: info -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Notice**, choosing both Tags and Commit hash is optional for every Test.

>ðŸ’¬ Definition alert! ðŸ””
**Commit hash** - the code version used by the Test

If you want that every test of this Job had the same values, click the 'Copy values to other Tests' button **4**.

Confirm by clicking the 'Save ang go to Arguments collections' button **5**.

### Choose Arguments Collections

In the second step, choose Global Arguments ðŸ’¬ you want to add to this Job. If there are many arguments on the list, use the filter above it **1**, and click the â€˜Save and go to Argumentsâ€™ button **2**.

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡ **Remember**, collections of Global Arguments are created in the [Global Arguments]() menu.

>ðŸ’¬ Definition alert! ðŸ””
**Global Arguments** - sets of values with names you can predefine globally and use when executing a set of tests (such as environment URLs or login credentials).
### Define Arguments Values

In the third step, you can edit the Local Arguments you added while creating the Tests. They will be used for this Job execution.

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡  **Remember**, if you set Global Arguments in the previous step, they will be overriding for the Local Arguments.
### Executing the Job

In the fourth step, choose one of two available methods of executing the Job:
Create Job immediately ðŸ’¬ **1** or Create Trigger ðŸ’¬ **2**.

>ðŸ’¬ Definition alert! ðŸ””
**Immediate Job** - the Job executed right away after creating it.
Trigger - an instruction to execute scripts on defined date and time.

#### Create Job Immediately 
Thatâ€™s straight forward action - the Job will be executed right away after clicking the â€˜Create Jobâ€™ button. 
The form will be shut down and you will see the window confirming creating New Job with its ID number **1** and two buttons:
â€˜Go back to job details/listâ€™ **2** - reopens the Test Plan/List view (depends on which view you started creating Job with - Test Plan or List); 
â€˜Go to the Jobs Detailsâ€™ **3** - takes you back to the Job detail view.

>ðŸ’¡  **Notice**, the time to build a new job depends on whether the virtual machines are ready or need to be created; the time bar will be informing you of the progress.
#### Create Trigger
Selecting this option gives you more alternatives regarding the scheduling and repeating Job in defined periods of time - in other words, you create the Trigger. The Job wonâ€™t be executed right away, but at a later point in time, or in specific intervals.
Choose the Execution Date and the Execution Time.


<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡  **Remember**, the Execution Time must be at least 5 minutes ahead.

If you donâ€™t want the Job to repeat, select the option â€˜Neverâ€™. 

<!-- theme: warning -->
>ðŸ’¡  **Remember**, you cannot set the Finish date if you selected the option â€˜Neverâ€™.

In case you wish to repeat the Job, choose the option â€˜Dailyâ€™, â€˜Weeklyâ€™, or â€˜Monthlyâ€™ and set the Finish date. 

All setup? Do not hesitate then and click the â€˜Create Triggerâ€™ button ðŸ‘†

The form will be shut down and you will see the window confirming creating New Job with the Triggerâ€™s ID number, Jobâ€™s name, schedule details, and two buttons:
â€˜Go back to the Test Plan/Listâ€™ - reopens the Test Plan/List view (depends on which view you started creating Job with - Test Plan or List); 
â€˜Go to the Trigger Detailsâ€™ - takes you back to the Job detail view.
