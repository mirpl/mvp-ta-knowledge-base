### Statuses
Now, let’s look closely at the statuses, and what they really mean. 👀


 When the Job has been ordered, but its execution hasn't started yet ??. In Details space, you will see the info: ‘No jobs were created for this order”, and there will be no Start and End Time provided. 

 When a new Job is created.

 When the Job is canceled by the user before it starts execution.

 When at least one connected Test is pending (and others can be created).

 When one of the Tests cannot be built, or the order cannot be submitted to the queue 😟. When you go to check the results, you will see the respective info in the ‘Output’ window. 

 When a robot could not be built.

  When at least one Test is currently running

 When the execution of this Job succeeded 😀. When you go to see the results, you will see the respective info in the ‘Output’ window.


You've gone so far in this exciting journey 👏. Catch some breath, and let's move on!
